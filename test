Wise smiled and said, "I know a special trick. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine you're floating on a soft, fluffy cloud."

Fuzzy closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and imagined himself lying on the fluffiest cloud in the sky. The cloud was so soft that it felt like a cozy blanket, and it slowly carried him across the night sky, past glowing stars and gentle moonlight.

As Fuzzy drifted, he felt warm and safe. The stars twinkled a lullaby, and the moon whispered, "Sleep, little one, tomorrow is full of more adventures."

Before Fuzzy knew it, he was fast asleep, dreaming of all the wonders he'd explore tomorrow.

From that night on, whenever Fuzzy couldn't sleep, he thought of his cloud, and sleep came to him like magic. And so, Fuzzy slept soundly every night, dreaming of the stars above.

The end.
